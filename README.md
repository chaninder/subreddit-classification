# subreddit-classification
In this project, we try to predict the subreddit of a post based on the comment. This was the final project for CSE 158: Recommender Systems (at UCSD). We employ various techniques such as web scraping, data cleaning, EDA, feature extraction/generation, NLP, machine learning, model evaluation, and hyperparameter-tuning to come up with a final model for this predictive task.
